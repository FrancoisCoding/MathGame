# Math Game strictly consisting of HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
This game targets children struggling to find a fun way to learn multiplacation, subtraction, and addidtion by providing an simple interface that engages them with fun sounds and cards. I learned how to integrate JavaScript to randomly generate questions with logic to select the correct answer in the problem presented.
